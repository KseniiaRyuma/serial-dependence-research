                        Thank you for your interest in our online experiment. We appreciate your time.
                    </p></b>
                    <p>
                        My name is David Whitney, Ph.D., I am a Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the Psychology department.
                        You are being invited to participate in a behavioral research study. The purpose of this study is to understand which regions of the brain are involved when people perceive objects and act towards them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Procedures</b></u><br>
                        The quality of our research data is very important to us. As you complete the following experiment, please try your best to precisely perceive all the pictures displayed and carefully pick your responses before answering. We monitor the quality of each participant's data to ensure that you are providing thoughtful responses.
                        If you agree to participate, you will be asked to make perceptual judgments about scenes on your computer screen and respond by pressing keys on your computer keypad.
                        Depending on the experiment, you may undergo a visual pre-test prior to the experiment. Only those participants that demonstrate a certain level of visual acuity may be eligible to continue participating in the full experiment. You will be paid for your time participating in the pre-test regardless of your performance level.
                        The session will last approximately 0.5 to 4 hours, but you may choose to discontinue at any time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Benefits</b></u><br>
                        There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in the study. However, this study will help scientists learn more about how the brain works, and it is hoped that this information will help in the treatment of future individuals with visual and cognitive disorders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Risks/Discomforts</b></u><br>
                        There are no more risks associated with this experiment than with watching a comparable period of television. As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we are taking precautions to minimize this risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Confidentiality</b></u><br>
                        Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or presented, your IP address, mechanical worker number, and other personally identifiable information will not be used. To minimize the risks to confidentiality, we will store the study data on a secure, password-protected computer system which will be identified only with the date and a subject code. Computers and files with study data are in a locked office only accessible to the research team. When the research is completed, we may save the study data for use in future research. We will retain this secure study information for up to 10 years after the study is over. The same measures described above will be taken to protect confidentiality of this study data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Compensation/Payment</b></u><br>
                        To thank you for participating in this study, you will receive $3.30 per hour through the Mechanical Turk system, and your total compensation will be determined based on the amount of time it generally takes to complete the experiment. For example, if the study generally takes 2 hours and 20 minutes to complete, you will receive $7.70 in total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><u>Rights</b></u><br>
                        Participation in research is completely voluntary. You have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in this study without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
                    </p>

                        If you have any questions or concerns about this study, you may email Ye Xia at yexia@berkeley.edu or Prof. David Whitney at dwhitney@berkeley.edu. If you have any questions or concerns about your rights and treatment as a research subject, you may contact the office of UC Berkeley's Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects,at 510-642-7461 or subjects@berkeley.edu.
